/*! \brief Select boundary condition handling scheme

    The vorticity reassigned to this vortex should be such that
    the fluid velocity, relative to the body surface, is zero.

    We can approximate this in a number of ways.  Here are some options:

    (a) Ignore all other contributions other than that of this vortex.
        Reassign this vorton's vorticity so that the fluid velocity,
        due only to this one vorton, is zero at the body surface.
        This simple scheme yields surprisingly pleasing results,
        perhaps better than (b) below, probably because, for all its simplicitiy,
        it does not double-count thie influence of the vorton being moved.
        And also, if the vorton is in contact with the body, its influence is
        likely dominate the ambient field anyway.

    (b) Interpolate the velocity at this point using the existing velocity field
        (which spuriously includes the influence of this vorton at its old position),
        then reassign this vorton's vorticity to counteract that.
        This can lead to instability if not damped.
        This technique is probably the worst of the three supplied here.

    (c) Interpolate velocity at this point using the existing velocity field,
        remove the contribution to that due to this vorton's old position and vorticity,
        then reassing this vorton's vorticity to counteract that.
        This arguably the most accurate of those mentioned here.

    (d) Like (c) but also (hypothetically) updating the ambient flow each time
        a vorton gets moved.  This would entail a tremendous amount of computation,
        so I mention it here only for the sake of providing a coherent sense of
        what is theoretically possible.

    In lieu of treating this as accurately as hypothetically possible, we recognize
    the following fact: Each of these schemes applies a correction to any vortons
    interacting with the body.  Choices (b) and (c) are likely to over-correct,
    not under-correct, since they omit the persistent change in the ambient flow
    (for this time step).  That implies we can (and should) apply only a portion
    of the correction, to each vorton, at each time step.  See DELAY_SHEDDING in
    the code below.

/*! \brief Collide particles with rigid bodies

    This uses a simplified form of "penalty" scheme
    which transfers linear and angular momentum between
    fluid particles and bodies immersed in the fluid.

    This implementation has some physical inaccuracies,
    described in comments in the code.

    A proper treatment of fluid-body interaction typically
    entails computing potential flow terms to add to the
    velocity induced by vorticity (which satisfies no-through
    boudnary conditions), and computing vorticity flux generated
    by viscous interactions between the fluid and body (which
    satisfies no-slip boundary conditions).  Or alternatively,
    one can introduce a "penalty" term into the fluid equations
    which pushes particles outside of bodies.

    In contrast, this scheme immediately projects particles embedded
    in bodies, to outside the bodies, and reassigns vorton vorticity
    (and hence angular momentum). This change in angular momentum in
    the flow is countered by an equal change in the body.

    Such accounting would only ever cause bodies to spin, not to
    translate, so in addition, any particle in contact with the body
    also imparts a linear momentum in proportion to the difference in
    relative velocity between the particle and the body.  This second
    part, the transfer of linear momentum, is not physically accurate,
    but the scheme is simpler than the alternatives, and leads
    to visually plausible results.

    Upon tracking total kinetic energy of the fluid and bodies,
    we should see it decrease (not increase) which would be
    consistent with transfering kinetic energy to heat.
    If the equations governing the fluid motion took into account
    heat (e.g. through a change in density which would then
    appear as a baroclinic term in the vorticity equation),
    then we could balance the energy budget.
